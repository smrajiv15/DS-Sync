/* Welcome to MyBookStore.com - This file tells you how to run the
 * server and the client program */

First Server should be started
------------------------------

1. SERVER directory contains Makefile which builds the corresponding executables
   for the source to run. It will provide the output executable as [server].

2. Then I have written a shell script which will start start the server.
   type : sh run.sh --> this will output as [ Server Stared ....].

Command steps:
-----------------

elk02:~/working/OS/stable/SERVER> make
cc server.c -o server -lpthread
elk02:~/working/OS/stable/SERVER> sh run.sh 
Server Started....

Next, Slave1 should be started
------------------------------

1. FRONT_END directory has three subdirectories, in which go inside SLAVE1 directory.
   Run the makefile to produce the executables need to run the slave1. It will provide the
   output executable as [slave1].

2. Then I have written a shell script which will start the slave1. Type sh run.sh -->
   this will ask for the back-end server IP address for connecting to the server.
   Ex: - [Enter the Server IP:XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX]. then the slave1 server is started.

Command steps:
--------------

elk03:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/SLAVE1> make
cc slave1.c -o slave1 -lpthread
elk03:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/SLAVE1> sh run.sh 
Enter the Server IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

Next, Slave2 should be started
------------------------------

1. FRONT_END directory has three subdirectories, in which go inside SLAVE2 directory.
   Run the makefile to produce the executables need to run the slave2. It will provide the
   output executable as [slave2].

2. Then I have written a shell script which will start the slave2. Type sh run.sh -->
   this will ask for the back-end server IP address for connecting to the server.
   Ex: - [Enter the Server IP:XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX]. then the slave2 server is started.

Command steps:
--------------

elk03:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/SLAVE2> make
cc slave1.c -o slave2 -lpthread
elk03:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/SLAVE2> sh run.sh 
Enter the Server IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX


Next, Master should be started
------------------------------

1. FRONT_END directory has three subdirectories, in which go inside MASTER directory.
   Run the makefile to produce the executables need to run the master. It will provide the
   output executable as [master].

2. Then I have written a shell script which will start the master. Type sh run.sh -->
   this will ask for the 3 IP addresses to connect with the 2 slaves and back-end Server.
   
Command steps:
--------------

elk05:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/MASTER> make
cc master.c -o master -lpthread
elk05:~/working/OS/stable/FRONT_END/MASTER> sh run.sh
Enter Slave1 IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
Enter Slave2 IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
Enter the Server IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
Master started....


Finally, Client should be started
------------------------------

1. In the CLIENT directory I have provided the makefile which builds the executables
   for the source to run. It will provide the output executable as [client].

2. Then I have written a shell script which will start the client.
   type: sh run.sh --> this will ask for the IP address for contacting to the
   front-end server like [ Enter the IP address: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX].

3. If it is a valid IP address of the front-end server, each of the functionality is returned
   with the appropriate information. else, [Error: Connecting Server Failed] message
   is displayed.

Command Steps:
--------------

elk02:~/working/OS/stable/CLIENT> make
cc client.c -o client -lpthread
elk02:~/working/OS/stable/CLIENT> sh run.sh 
Enter any Front end Server IP:
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
